					<p>Unfortunately, we know very little about the Bowling Green.  It was one of two bowling alleys in Needham, along with the Needham Bowlaway.  The Bowling Green was in operation from about the 1930s until the 1970s.  Bowling was a very popular pastime during those years, and the Bowling Green was a popular spot both for family entertainment and more formal league bowling. One of the Green&#39;s champion bowlers was also often featured on Don Gillis&#39; TV show 'Candlepin Bowling' (WCVB).</p>

					<p>The Bowling Green was the more 'respectable' of Needham&#39;s two bowling alleys.  The Bowlaway was older (opened in 1917) and in a basement.  It had pool tables in addition to the lanes, so it was more of a men&#39;s hangout.  Since the Bowling Green was brighter and had no pool tables, it was considered more comfortable for children and ladies.</p>

					<p>As the popularity of bowling declined, Needham could no longer support two bowling alleys.  The Bowlaway hung on by installing laser lights and specializing in children&#39;s parties, replacing the pool tables with birthday-party tables. The Bowling Green closed sometime in the 1970s, and the site became an auto-parts store.  The YMCA moved into the building in the 1990s and built its Active Family Center.</p>

					<p>TripAdvisor was founded in February 2000 in a small office above Kosta&#39;s Pizza on Chestnut Street. The original plan was to offer a central location for travelers to find reviews from professional sources and reviewers.  However, a sidebar feature allowing travelers to add their own reviews took off, quickly outpacing the professional reviews, and rapidly transformed the site into a source for user-generated information. By 2007, 10 million reviews had been posted, reaching 200 million by the end of 2014.</p>

					<p>Site content has grown to include restaurants, rentals, cruises, and other attractions.  Comparison and booking facilities allow users to make travel arrangements on-site. The company now includes more than 25 travel brands and operates websites in more than 30 countries. In 15 years, TripAdvisor has become the world’s largest travel site, with approximately 300 million unique visitors per month.</p>

						<figcaption>First location &#8211; 1004 Great Plain Avenue &#8211; this is Roche Bros first store in Needham (and second store overall), in 1963 (note the banner in the window &#8211; &#34;We&#39;re 11 years Old&#34;)</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In 1952 two young men named Pat and Buddy (Daniel) Roche opened a tiny meat market in Roslindale, financed by their parents, who were willing to mortgage their home to help their boys fulfill a dream of owning their own store. A produce department was soon added. In a few years the dress shop next door closed, and within a week Pat and Buddy were expanding their store.</p> 

					<p>The enlarged store had a grand opening on June 10, 1957. Buddy was so nervous about the new store that just six days later &#8211; even though it was his wedding day &#8211; he showed up that morning ready to go to work.</p> 

					<p>By 1959 business was booming, and the Roche brothers began looking for a site for another store. They heard that Crossman's, a long time grocery store at the corner of Chestnut Street and Great Plain Avenue in Needham, was going out of business. The building was much larger than the one in Roslindale, had a cellar and a second floor, and much lower rent. They managed to find finances to open the store, but still didn't have access to the building. The owner agreed to meet with them at the Roslindale store. When he arrived the store was extremely busy, and he was quickly convinced he wanted the brothers as tenants. The Needham store opened just a few weeks before Thanksgiving in 1959.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>Business was slow at first, but picked up as the store became better known. The women of the Congregational Church became regular customers because Buddy not only gave them good prices for the food served at their meetings, but went to the church to slice the meat for them. Word quickly spread that Roche Bros. not only sold good food, but gave excellent service as well. In 1960, stores in Needham typically closed down at 6:00 PM, with no chance of buying food or other goods. Buddy kept the store open until 9:00, and soon the store was kept busy every night except Sundays, when the old Blue Laws kept all businesses shuttered.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>Pat ran the Roslindale market, and Buddy ran the new store in Needham. As time went on and the stores were flourishing they wanted to expand again. As Buddy drove down Chestnut Street on his way to work he passed an empty lot in front of the railroad tracks. One day a friend told him it belonged to Bill Linse of Miller and Linse, Builders. He went to see Bill Linse, who was interested, but it took more than a year before they signed an agreement of sale. Once again Buddy and Pat were faced with the problem of financing a new store. One day a customer named George Young from Dover entered the store to pick up an order his wife had called in. He told Buddy his wife liked the store, gave Buddy his card and told him to call if he ever needed money. The brothers made an appointment and went into Boston to see him, hoping to borrow around fifty thousand. After Mr. Young heard their plans he told them he would arrange a loan for them for one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars. A Needham architect was hired, and on February 9, 1965  the new Roche Bros. celebrated a grand opening. That was the beginning of what was to become a veritable legend. By that time Buddy had grown to like the town so much that he and his wife, Eileen, moved from Walpole and made Needham their permanent home.</p>

					<p>When Needham&#39;s other grocery store, the Stop & Shop on Highland Avenue, closed in 1989, the town's only grocery store was Roche Bros. Since the store was not as large as they needed and had no room for expansion,  Buddy and Pat bought the Stop & Shop building and opened it as a second store under their new &#34;Sudbury Farms&#34; brand.</p>

					<p>Over the years, in all their stores, Buddy and Pat were known for their generosity and helpfulness when needed. They gave to countless organizations with a smile. A young employee who had a fire in her home couldn't believe how the management stepped in to help her get settled again. They hired handicapped people to give them pride in their accomplishments. They are on the list of Best Employers in the state since 2008.  Perhaps the most notable of their countless good deeds came during the Hurricane of 1978 when people stranded on Route 128 were brought to St. Bartholomew&#39;s Church in Needham by snow mobile.  When the Red Cross contacted Buddy for help, his answer was for them to come to the store and just take what they needed. No bill was ever presented.  Never ones to publicize what they did, no one will ever know the extent of their giving.</p> 

					<p>Pat Roche died in May of 2012, Buddy in September of 2013. They are missed by all who were lucky enough to know what exceptional men they were.  The Roche Brothers company, now run by the sons of Buddy and Pat, has expanded to 18 stores in eastern Massachusetts and the Cape, and is starting a new venture called Brothers Marketplace.</p>

					<p>Needham&#39;s first library association was formed in 1796 as a private subscription library. Each member paid $3.00 to join, with an annual fee of twenty-five cents to be put aside for additional books. Several other subscription libraries were formed in the following century, but it was not until 1888 that Needham Town Meeting voted to create a free public library, that was open to all without fee.  The Library was housed in various town facilities, until the current site on Rosemary Street was finally built in 1916.</p>

					<p>Library use grew rapidly, and in 1945 a small branch library was opened for two days per week in the Flax Building, at 1054 Great Plain Avenue.  The Branch was convenient for those who had business in Needham Center, and was especially popular for its children&#39;s programs.  In the 1960s, the main library closed for additions and remodeling, making the Branch the only library for a while.  In 1985, facing a funding shortfall, the Library closed the Branch and the site returned to business use.</p>

					<h3>Needham Public Library</h3>

					<p>The Proprietors of the Needham Library formed in 1796 as an association to provide the townspeople with books. Each member paid $3.00 to join, and an annual fee of twenty-five cents was put aside for additional books. Over the years there were several other private or subscription libraries, open to those who could pay the fees.</p>

					<p>In 1888 Town Meeting voted to establish a free public library, open to everyone; it was to be funded by the dog tax. The Free Public Library was first located in a rented room above a store on Great Plain Avenue, moving to a larger space in the Emery Grover Building in 1898, and then to the Town Hall in 1908. Lack of space, however, was a constant problem, and larger quarters were needed.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1910lib.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>This is Needham’s first public library building, built in 1904 at the corner of Highland Avenue and Mellen Street.  The land and building were donated by manufacturer William Carter and by Andrew Carnegie.  Residents of Needham Center, however, were not pleased about locating the library in the Heights, so within 10 years, town funding was found to build the current library on the corner of Highland Avenue and Rosemary Street.  Christ Church (Episcopal) was at that time next to the Library, and moved to its current location near Rosemary Street a few years later.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Proposals were made to build the Public Library its own building, but this effort stalled over expenditure in 1904.  To solve this problem, Needham manufacturer and philanthropist William Carter, and Andrew Carnegie (a self-educated man, and strong supporter of the free public library movement) built a library building on land donated by Carter at the corner of Mellen Street and Highland Avenue. Residents of Needham Center, however, were not entirely pleased that the town’s first Library was located in the Heights, so they continued to use the Town Hall rooms in preference to using a library in the Heights. So, within 10 years the money was found to build a new building.  William Carter gave the town land on Rosemary Street (the traditional &#34;boundary&#34; between the two parts of town), and everyone was satisfied with the location.</p>

						<figcaption>Glover Hospital, 1950s, showing the new clinic building as the main structure</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital &#8211; Needham on Chestnut Street is about to open state-of-the-art cancer and surgical facilities, the latest part of a renovation and expansion that has been going on for several years.  The hospital has been an affiliate of the Deaconess hospital system since 1994.  After the Deaconess and Beth Israel Hospitals merged, the decision was made to expand and modernize the hospital into a regional medical center.  Looking at this modern hospital, it is hard to remember that underneath it all is a century-old local clinic, still known around town as The Glover.</p>

					<p>The Glover Home and Hospital was named after Frederick Pope Glover, who bequeathed his estate to the town for the purpose of founding a hospital in his name.  Glover was not a doctor, as is often supposed.  He had been, at various points in his life, a shoemaker, a shopkeeper, a gold prospector during the Gold Rush, a railroad surveyor, a mule-driver, a trail guide, real estate speculator, and again a shopkeeper.  He settled in Needham later in his life, and served the town in several capacities, including a term or two as Selectman.</p>

					<p>Around 1890, Glover set up a business near Harris Avenue selling spring water &#8211; drawing on the same source that supplied the Dedham St. reservoir.  The Bird&#39;s Hill Spring Water Company was successful, and Glover acquired a moderate fortune.  Without children or much other family, Needham was the main beneficiary of his generosity.</p>

					<p>When he died in 1901, Glover bequeathed his property and assets to the town on the condition that they convert his Chestnut Street home into a hospital within two years, or the funds would revert to the Overseers of the Poor for the relief of the deserving poor in town.  However, the town government did not want a hospital &#8211; the Boston hospitals were quite close enough, thank you.  They preferred to use the money for other purposes, particularly (and ironically) improvements to the municipal water system.</p>

					<p>But there were also strong factions in town who could see the benefits of having a local hospital. The mill owners in the Heights, especially J.B. Thorpe and William Carter, favored the plan for the benefit of their employees, who were subject to frequent injuries by the nature of their work. Local doctors, particularly William Mitchell, looked forward to having local access to surgical facilities.  Glover’s executor, William Moseley, was also a mill owner, and he dragged his feet in turning over the funds to the Overseers in expectation that the hospital plan would eventually come through.  It finally did in 1910, when Town Meeting reluctantly voted to accept the gift after all.  The hospital opened on September 16, 1912.</p>

					<p>The first hospital was an 11-bed facility, with small operating and obstetrical rooms, a nursery, and two wards.  Charges did not cover costs and the hospital was chronically in debt.  Nevertheless, it was well-used, especially for maternity &#8211; in its first full year of operation, there were 122 patients, and 22 babies.</p>

					<p>The hospital really came into its own in 1918, when the flu epidemic reached Needham.  The Spanish Influenza devastated Europe in the closing years of World War I.  It spread rapidly in the close and filthy conditions of the trenches, and the death rate among the already exhausted soldiers was high.  Troops returning from the Front accelerated the spread of the flu through the civilian population.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1920glover.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Glover Hospital, 1920s: Glover&#39;s house was converted into the original clinic, The Glover home and Hospital.  A more modern clinic was built to its north (left, in picture) in 1936 and the old Glover house became the nurses&#39; quarters.  When the building expanded again in the 1940s, the house was torn down to make room for the new wing.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The first cases in Needham were recorded in mid-September 1918, and by the following week totaled nearly 200. The Board of Health was not set up to meet such a crisis, and was completely overwhelmed.  Selectman David Murdoch organized an Emergency Health Committee of municipal officials, doctors, the Red Cross and the Visiting Nurses, and took over the hospital for emergency use.  The Committee established quarantine procedures, pressed the local tradesmen into service to expand the hospital&#39;s plumbing and heating systems, tripled the number of beds, hired additional doctors and nurses, set up an emergency kitchen, and dragooned 25 local drivers into using their cars as ambulances and transports.</p>

					<p>The outbreak finally subsided in January. There were several hundred cases and 121 hospitalizations, but only 22 deaths.  The relatively small number of deaths was a credit to the rapid actions of the Emergency Health Committee, and to the facilities and staff of the Glover Hospital.  The emergency did no good at all for the hospital&#39;s financial state, but following the flu outbreak, no one doubted any longer the benefits of having a good local hospital.  &#34;A hospital appeals very strongly to me.  The times through which we have just passed show how much we need such an institution.  A hospital will be a comfort always to those who need it.&#34; (Town Clerk Thomas Sutton, letter to the Needham Chronicle, 8 February 1919)

					<h5>The Needham Police Department</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1911police.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Needham Police in the Needham Bicentennial parade, 1911</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In the early days of Needham, those we now call Police Officers were called Constables. Although they had many duties, the most important were keeping the peace, and the collection of delinquent taxes. Every &#34;responsible&#34; man in town was required to fill the position for at least one year.  By the mid-1800s Needham began appointing special policemen when additional law enforcement might be needed, such as public celebrations. Night watchmen were also hired for special duty.</p>

					<p>Needham&#39;s first Chief of Police was Norman McKenzie, who held the office from 1891 until his death in 1929.  Formerly a night watchman, he went on daytime duty when he became Chief.  However, he was so ridiculed for wasting his time (and the town&#39;s money) that he reassigned himself to night duty.  Daytime police patrols became common only after 1900, when the electric trolley lines brought larger numbers of people into town.</p>

					<p>Our first police vehicle was a horse and wagon, borrowed when needed.  The wagon also served as an ambulance, although it was too short and the stretchers stuck out in the back. Chief McKenzie had long argued for a replacement, because The wagon was finally replaced by a Ford Phaeton police cruiser in 1930.</p>

					<p>From its beginning to the present day, the Needham Police Department has lost only two men in the line of duty, when Francis O. Haddock and Forbes A. McLeod were shot during the robbery of the Needham Trust Company on February 2, 1934.</p>

					<p>As the population increased, the need for law-enforcement grew, and additional patrol officers were hired. Our present Police Departmen has approximately 40 officers. We have modern, up to date cruisers with on-board access to statewide databases; officers also maintain regular bicycle patrols, and are trained and equipped for water rescue.</p>

					<p>In addition to their law-enforcement duties, our police officers now work with many committees in town, such as traffic management, suicide prevention, emergency planning, domestic violence, and human rights. They have come a long way from collecting delinquent taxes.</p>

The station was across the street from the current fire station, near the Needham Garden Center&#39;s repair center.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>For many years the fire department of Needham consisted of any men in town who were physically capable of fighting a fire. Records indicate that the volunteers were rewarded for their efforts with &#34;rum and spirits.&#34;</p>

					<p>By the early 1800s, Needham had organized a force of &#34;fire engineers&#34; to respond to fires in town, but for the most part this response was haphazard. Fires were fought with buckets of water, and the primary task was to rescue people and valuables from the burning building, since there was little chance of actually putting out a large fire. </p>

					<p>Needham began to acquire fire engines in the 1870s: hand-pumped tankers that could bring large amounts of water to the scene. Surrounding towns also sent engines to each other when needed. In 1885, the town organized a systematic fire response, building two fire houses&#8211; Company #1 in Needham Center, and Company #2 in the Heights. A town wide alarm system and a hydrant system were installed a few years later.  It was 1917 before the town purchased its first motorized fire apparatus, a combination pumper&#45;ladder which had a 60 horsepower engine.</p>

					<p>In 1941, a precedent was set when 62 women from 22 Massachusetts cities and towns were trained as fire-fighters.  Every week a group of Needham fire-fighters, headed by Chief Richard Salamone, taught them to climb ladders, to balance on an aerial ladder while keeping their hands free for action, to jump 30 feet from a tower into a life net, to fight a fire wearing gas masks, and to handle high pressure hoses. It is now taken for granted that women are fully capable of being fire-fighters, but in those early days of World War II it was an exceptional occurrence.</p>

					<p>The Needham Fire Department has grown from a small group of untrained volunteers to a permanent staff of well-trained professionals who take pride in protecting the lives and property of the citizens of the town.  Although we think of them first as fire-fighters, they are also expert as EMT&#39;s (emergency medical technicians), and hazardous materials handlers.</p>

					<h5>The 9/11 Memorial for First Responders</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/911dedication.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Dedication of the 9/11 Memorial, on 11 September 2014</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>On September 11, 2001, twelve of  Needham&#39;s First Responders rushed to New York City in response to the attacks on the World Trade Center.  These men spent many days working side-by-side with other first responders at Ground Zero.  The impact was profound and immeasurable.  Each year on September 11th, the Needham Police and Fire Departments pay tribute to the uniformed men and women who answered the call to action, and to the many who lost their lives on September 11, 2001:  343 firefighters, 60 police officers, 15 EMT/medics and 3 court officers, in addition to the 2000+ personnel who were injured.</p>   
					
					<p>The idea for a 9/11 Memorial was started by Mark McCullough and Joe O&#39;Brien (Needham Police Dept., ret.) in the summer of 2012.  They were discussing 9/11 Memorials and how there wasn&#39;t one in Needham, and that other Towns had memorials that featured an artifact from the World Trade Center.  The idea of having a memorial for the annual 9/11 ceremony grew from their conversations.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>The Needham 9/11 Memorial Committee was established to design and erect a memorial to honor those first responders, including our own Needham personnel. This new 9/11 Memorial for First Responders, located outside of the Needham Police & Fire Stations, is a respectful tribute and will provide a permanent place for the annual September 11th ceremony. The Needham Police and Fire Departments obtained a piece of a steel beam from one of the World Trade Center buildings.  This pitted and scarred piece of steel is approximately one foot square, and will be the centerpiece of the 9/11 Memorial.</p>

					<p>The memorial is designed to incorporate symbols of the several incidents on that day.  The base is in the shape of a pentagon, symbolizing the attack on the Pentagon.  The New York skyline and the Twin Towers represent the attacks on the World Trade Center, as does the steel beam fragment. The rear of the monument features rock and soil from the crash site of Flight 93 that went down in Shanksville, PA.  The etched portraits honor Needham’s own First Responders who took part in the 9/11 search and rescue. </p>

					<h5>Kimball School</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1880kimball.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Kimball School c. 1880 &#8211; as originally built</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In 1853 a town committee was chosen to report on the condition of the town schools, and to consider the advisability of establishing one or more high schools. The although a high school was recommended, nothing was done. In 1864, another committee considered the need of a high school, and reported that the town was legally bound to have such a school. In May of that year the town voted to build two high schools, neither to exceed $1200 in cost.</p>

					<p>One, the West High School, was opened in Wellesley, which was the West Parish of Needham at the time. The other, the East High School, was opened in the upper part of the old Center school house (Nehoiden Street), but was soon after moved into Village Hall, a privately-owned business building on Great Plain Avenue.  The committee again proposed a new building to the 1869 Town Meeting. The idea was accepted, but the building committee could not finalize the details, so no action was taken. In the meantime the East High School classes were now being held at the Oakland Hall School, a private school on the corner of Highland Avenue and May Street.  In 1871, a grammar school was built on the corner of Chestnut and School Streets, for a cost of $10,000.  The building had three rooms, one on each floor.  The youngest children on the first floor, grammar school on the second &#8211; and at long last &#8211; a High School on the third.</p>

					<p>However, within five years the new School was so over-crowded that some classes had to be held in rented rooms above a store on Great Plain Avenue. So, in 1886 the school building was cut in half, and the ends separated. The area between the ends was filled with new classroom space, and new wings were added.  At the same time the name was changed to the Kimball School in honor of the Reverend Daniel Kimball, who had run a day and boarding school from his home at the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Marked Tree Road. Dr. Kimball was a member of the School Committee for 23 years, often serving as chairman. He was also the President of the first temperance society in town, a justice of the peace, and representative to the General Court.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1886kimball.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Kimball School after the additions were built in 1886.  There were two entrances &#8211; the girls&#39; entrance was on the left side, and the boys&#39; entrance on the right. (postcard, dated 1909)</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>When the school was first built, a water boy was chosen each day to go to the well and pump water into a pail, which was passed around while students drank from a tin dipper. The custom was stopped in 1890 when a public water supply was brought to the town.  Almost forty years later, a workman uncovered well masonry in the center of town. It turned out to be the old well, 30 feet deep, with about two feet of crystal clear water.</p>

					<p>In 1889 the town voted to spend $1500.00 to improve the ventilation in the Kimball School, and in 1897 proper rest rooms were erected in the basement at a cost of $250.00.  Stairs were later added to the sides of the building to be used as fire escapes, but shortly became the common way of entering the hallways.</p>

					<p>By 1930 the Kimball School was in such antiquated condition that the town was considering closing it.  At the same time a new fire and police building were badly needed. It was determined that the location of the school would be ideal for a fire and police station and would save the town some $40,000 for the cost of land. Closure of the Kimball depended not only upon having a suitable future site for the students, but authorization of the voters and the school committee. It was agreed that an addition to the Stephen Palmer School on May Street was the best solution. A special town meeting was called which approved the appropriations on June 28th; by the first week in December the new quarters were ready for some classes, and all was ready for the students when they returned from Christmas vacation. The last day of classes were held at the Kimball School on December 6, 1930. </p>

					<h3>The Norfolk Trust Co. Robbery, 1934</h3>

					</figure>

					<p>The Norfolk Trust Bank was robbed in February 1934 by the Millen-Faber gang from Boston. The members of the gang were brothers Murton and Irving Millen, Abraham Faber, and Norma Brighton Millen (wife of Murton, who drove the getaway car). They timed the robbery by the train schedule, so that the trains passing across Great Plain Avenue would hinder the police trying to reach the Bank.</p>

					<figure>

					<p>The gang held up the Bank with machine guns &#8211; the first machine-gun crime in MA &#8211; wounding two of the Bank personnel, and briefly taking one hostage. During their escape, they also killed two members of Needham&#39;s small police force, Forbes McLeod and Francis Haddock, as they responded to the alarm. Assigned to downtown patrol, Haddock and McLeod were well known in the community. The robbers also wounded a fireman, Timothy Coughlin, as they sped through the Heights.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/gang.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The Millen-Faber gang (left to right):  brothers Irving and Murton Millen, and Abraham Faber.  Murton was a small-time crook when he teamed up with Faber, an MIT graduate.  The two planned a series of increasingly daring and violent robberies in the greater Boston area. In 1934, they stole a pair of Thompson sub-machine guns from the State Police Armory, and used them to hold up the Needham Trust Co. It is not clear why they targeted Needham, but possibly because they figured that a small-town police force would be no match for them.  They were tracked to New York and captured, and all three were executed.</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>The robbers were caught fairly quickly, and the men tried and executed. The slain officers were given heroes&#39; funerals; schools and offices were closed so people could attend to pay their respects. In gratitude for their sacrifice, the town voted pensions to support their widows, and the Bank established a fund to provide education for their young children.</p>

Both men were in their 30s and married, Haddock leaving behind four young daughters. The town voted a pension for their wives, and established an education fund for Haddock&#39;s children.  They are the only Needham police officers killed in the line of duty.</figcaption>

					<h3>The Town Hall and Common</h3>

					<a href = "#BowlingGreen">First: The Bowling Green</a>

					<p><a href="map.html#map-page?towncenter" data-ajax="false" rel = "external"> Get directions. </a></p>

					<p>Needham at the turn of the 20th century was a town in transition, as a rising class of merchants and professionals settled into homes surrounding the new business center of Great Plain Avenue. Children spent more time in the classroom than they did at home learning their parents&#39; trades. And the excellent train service to Boston was making commuting &#8211; and suburban living &#8211; increasingly convenient.</p>

					<p>Needham was also undergoing a physical transition. In 1853, the new trains bypassed the old town center on Central Avenue and ran into the mostly-empty Great Plain. By 1880 the old center was abandoned. Then Wellesley split off from Needham in 1881. The town purchased a large square of land in 1884 to become the new Common, bounded by Highland and Great Plain Avenues and Chapel Street. Building a new Town Hall was debated for 20 years, but the new century brought new optimism and energy. Town Meeting recognized the urgent need for &#34;proper and fitting accommodations&#34; for the town&#39;s business &#8211; and a desire to present the town as a dynamic and modern locale for residence and commerce.

					 <p>Town Hall was a civic monument to Needham&#39;s Twentieth Century identity: &#34;We have only to consider... what is the necessary and wise course to pursue in providing a suitable building... so that the stranger landing in our town will not be obliged to ask, &#34;Where is the Town Hall?&#34; &#8211; but it will speak for itself, and for the progressive spirit of our people.&#34;</p> 
					 
					 <p>&#8211; Selectman Edgar H. Bowers</p>


					<h5>First Parish</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1870parish.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The first Parish church shown in its original location at the intersection of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue, circa 1870.  This intersection was the original center of Needham, but building the railroad through the Great Plain in 1853 drew businesses and activity toward the Center Station, creating a new center within about 20 years.  The First Parish church was lifted and moved to its current location on Dedham Avenue in 1878.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>The first organized parish in Needham was formed as a result of the separation of Needham from Dedham on November 6, 1711. The legal definition of a Town in Massachusetts was a church, a school, and the means to pay a minister. Therefore, the church was by law an essential part of the town governance.</p>
					
					<p>The church was originally located in the old town center, at the corner of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue. The current (third) structure, which dates to 1836, was lifted and moved to the corner of Great Plain and Dedham Avenues in 1878 after the advent of the railroad caused the town center to shift to its present location. The bell in its steeple, which still rings today, was cast by Paul Revere in 1811 for the Needham Centennial.</p>
					
					<p>The church&#39;s recent renovations restored the historic sanctuary, expanded the program space, and reduced energy usage by 50% - making it the first house of worship in Massachusetts to earn the EPA&#39;s Energy Star rating.</p>

					<h5>The Needham Paramount Cinema</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1944theater.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Needham Paramount Theater in 1944.  The picture can be dated by its marquee, which announces the film &#34;Arsenic and Old Lace&#34; with Cary Grant. The neighboring stores are a she store, a hat shop, a clothing store, and a diner.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>When the idea of a movie theater in Needham arose in 1913, concerned citizens had many objections, stating it would be a major threat to the morality of young people, not to speak of the damage to their eyes. Obviously school work would suffer, and nearby property would decrease in value.</p>

					<p>All applications for a permit were denied until 1915, when Selectman David Murdoch was allowed to open a theater in the Bourne building on the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chestnut Street. One of the regulations in the license named the Selectmen as censors, and Murdoch resigned from the Board to avoid conflict of interest. The theater was a success despite the lack of facilities for music to accompany the silent movies, and in 1925 he constructed a new building, specifically designed to be a theater, on Great Plain Avenue between Dedham Avenue and the intersection with Pickering Street.</p>

					<p>The theater was a showplace, with marble walls, a circular domed ceiling in the lobby, and a special theater organ which supplied the musical background until talkies were developed. Decorative plaster pieces, including a crest with the theater&#39;s initials, were displayed throughout the building. With 768 leather seats in the orchestra and 348 in the balcony, the patrons had plenty of room to relax.</p>

					<p>The theater was run by Dave Murdoch, Jr. until 1929, when the building was leased to the Paramount Publix organization. In 1953 the Murdochs sold the building. Business declinesd in the 1960s as audiences were drawn to the large showcase theaters, and in 1978 the theater was sold to two men who attempted to bring X-rated movies to Needham. Intervention by the Selectmen put a stop to that immediately.  By the 1980s, the building was caught up in a property dispute, maintained by neither side (for fear that the other would benefit), and the building deteriorated quickly. In 2001 the old theater was razed by the Town for safety reasons.  All that is left are a few pieces of plaster and lots of memories of pep rallies, shows, and movie date nights. A new building containing shops and condominiums is being built at the site.
					</p>

					<h5>Police Kiosk</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1946kiosk.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The police kiosk at Dedham Avenue, 1946 &#8211; the policeman at his post, 1946. </figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>Until 1915 the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Dedham Avenue was a triangular piece of land owned by Clifford M. Locke. Close to the point of the triangle was a 65 foot elm tree, which sheltered a horse drinking trough. Traffic was difficult, and made worse by trolley tracks near the tree. At the suggestion of the Board of Selectmen Mr. Locke deeded the land to the town, the tree was taken down and a street section was built with granite curbing. There was a desirable improvement at the site due to an increase in safety to automobiles, and a more pleasant appearance.  As traffic increased in the center of town a small kiosk was set up on an island in the center of the intersection. During heavy commuter times a policeman would stand in the kiosk and direct traffic. This arrangement lasted until 1970, when the island was removed and signal lights were installed</p>

					<h5>The Crest</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1950screst.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The Crest, 1950s</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>Located at the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chapel Street, The Crest provided several generations of Needhamites with newspapers, cigars, comic books, ice cream, and other miscellaneous goods.  The store opened during the First World War, and stayed in business until 1995.  The location was the site of several short-lived banks, and is now houses a wine store, but the corner is still frequently referred to as The Crest.</p>

					<h5>Downtown Scenes</h5>

						<figcaption>Moseley Block 1880 &#8211; the large business/retail building on the SW corner of great Plain Avenue and Chestnut street was first known as the Moseley Block, though later owners changed the name (May Block, then Bourne Block).  Built in 1874, it housed several retail stores on the first floor, and office and meeting spaces on the second and third.  It was torn down in 1923 to make was for the current one-story retail block.
