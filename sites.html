					<p>Unfortunately, we know very little about the Bowling Green.  It was one of two bowling alleys in Needham, along with the Needham Bowlaway.  The Bowling Green was in operation from about the 1930s until the 1970s.  Bowling was a very popular pastime during those years, and the Bowling Green was a popular spot both for family entertainment and more formal league bowling. One of the Green&#39;s champion bowlers was also often featured on Don Gillis&#39; TV show 'Candlepin Bowling' (WCVB).</p>

					<p>The Bowling Green was the more 'respectable' of Needham&#39;s two bowling alleys.  The Bowlaway was older (opened in 1917) and in a basement.  It had pool tables in addition to the lanes, so it was more of a men&#39;s hangout.  Since the Bowling Green was brighter and had no pool tables, it was considered more comfortable for children and ladies.</p>

					<p>As the popularity of bowling declined, Needham could no longer support two bowling alleys.  The Bowlaway hung on by installing laser lights and specializing in children&#39;s parties, replacing the pool tables with birthday-party tables. The Bowling Green closed sometime in the 1970s, and the site became an auto-parts store.  The YMCA moved into the building in the 1990s and built its Active Family Center.</p>

					<p>TripAdvisor was founded in February 2000 in a small office above Kosta&#39;s Pizza on Chestnut Street. The original plan was to offer a central location for travelers to find reviews from professional sources and reviewers.  However, a sidebar feature allowing travelers to add their own reviews took off, quickly outpacing the professional reviews, and rapidly transformed the site into a source for user-generated information. By 2007, 10 million reviews had been posted, reaching 200 million by the end of 2014.</p>

					<p>Site content has grown to include restaurants, rentals, cruises, and other attractions.  Comparison and booking facilities allow users to make travel arrangements on-site. The company now includes more than 25 travel brands and operates websites in more than 30 countries. In 15 years, TripAdvisor has become the world’s largest travel site, with approximately 300 million unique visitors per month.</p>

						<figcaption>First location &#8211; 1004 Great Plain Avenue &#8211; this is Roche Bros first store in Needham (and second store overall), in 1963 (note the banner in the window &#8211; &#34;We&#39;re 11 years Old&#34;)</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In 1952 two young men named Pat and Buddy (Daniel) Roche opened a tiny meat market in Roslindale, financed by their parents, who were willing to mortgage their home to help their boys fulfill a dream of owning their own store. A produce department was soon added. In a few years the dress shop next door closed, and within a week Pat and Buddy were expanding their store.</p> 

					<p>The enlarged store had a grand opening on June 10, 1957. Buddy was so nervous about the new store that just six days later &#8211; even though it was his wedding day &#8211; he showed up that morning ready to go to work.</p> 

					<p>By 1959 business was booming, and the Roche brothers began looking for a site for another store. They heard that Crossman's, a long time grocery store at the corner of Chestnut Street and Great Plain Avenue in Needham, was going out of business. The building was much larger than the one in Roslindale, had a cellar and a second floor, and much lower rent. They managed to find finances to open the store, but still didn't have access to the building. The owner agreed to meet with them at the Roslindale store. When he arrived the store was extremely busy, and he was quickly convinced he wanted the brothers as tenants. The Needham store opened just a few weeks before Thanksgiving in 1959.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>Business was slow at first, but picked up as the store became better known. The women of the Congregational Church became regular customers because Buddy not only gave them good prices for the food served at their meetings, but went to the church to slice the meat for them. Word quickly spread that Roche Bros. not only sold good food, but gave excellent service as well. In 1960, stores in Needham typically closed down at 6:00 PM, with no chance of buying food or other goods. Buddy kept the store open until 9:00, and soon the store was kept busy every night except Sundays, when the old Blue Laws kept all businesses shuttered.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>Pat ran the Roslindale market, and Buddy ran the new store in Needham. As time went on and the stores were flourishing they wanted to expand again. As Buddy drove down Chestnut Street on his way to work he passed an empty lot in front of the railroad tracks. One day a friend told him it belonged to Bill Linse of Miller and Linse, Builders. He went to see Bill Linse, who was interested, but it took more than a year before they signed an agreement of sale. Once again Buddy and Pat were faced with the problem of financing a new store. One day a customer named George Young from Dover entered the store to pick up an order his wife had called in. He told Buddy his wife liked the store, gave Buddy his card and told him to call if he ever needed money. The brothers made an appointment and went into Boston to see him, hoping to borrow around fifty thousand. After Mr. Young heard their plans he told them he would arrange a loan for them for one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars. A Needham architect was hired, and on February 9, 1965  the new Roche Bros. celebrated a grand opening. That was the beginning of what was to become a veritable legend. By that time Buddy had grown to like the town so much that he and his wife, Eileen, moved from Walpole and made Needham their permanent home.</p>

					<p>When Needham&#39;s other grocery store, the Stop & Shop on Highland Avenue, closed in 1989, the town's only grocery store was Roche Bros. Since the store was not as large as they needed and had no room for expansion,  Buddy and Pat bought the Stop & Shop building and opened it as a second store under their new &#34;Sudbury Farms&#34; brand.</p>

					<p>Over the years, in all their stores, Buddy and Pat were known for their generosity and helpfulness when needed. They gave to countless organizations with a smile. A young employee who had a fire in her home couldn't believe how the management stepped in to help her get settled again. They hired handicapped people to give them pride in their accomplishments. They are on the list of Best Employers in the state since 2008.  Perhaps the most notable of their countless good deeds came during the Hurricane of 1978 when people stranded on Route 128 were brought to St. Bartholomew&#39;s Church in Needham by snow mobile.  When the Red Cross contacted Buddy for help, his answer was for them to come to the store and just take what they needed. No bill was ever presented.  Never ones to publicize what they did, no one will ever know the extent of their giving.</p> 

					<p>Pat Roche died in May of 2012, Buddy in September of 2013. They are missed by all who were lucky enough to know what exceptional men they were.  The Roche Brothers company, now run by the sons of Buddy and Pat, has expanded to 18 stores in eastern Massachusetts and the Cape, and is starting a new venture called Brothers Marketplace.</p>

					<p>Needham&#39;s first library association was formed in 1796 as a private subscription library. Each member paid $3.00 to join, with an annual fee of twenty-five cents to be put aside for additional books. Several other subscription libraries were formed in the following century, but it was not until 1888 that Needham Town Meeting voted to create a free public library, that was open to all without fee.  The Library was housed in various town facilities, until the current site on Rosemary Street was finally built in 1916.</p>

					<p>Library use grew rapidly, and in 1945 a small branch library was opened for two days per week in the Flax Building, at 1054 Great Plain Avenue.  The Branch was convenient for those who had business in Needham Center, and was especially popular for its children&#39;s programs.  In the 1960s, the main library closed for additions and remodeling, making the Branch the only library for a while.  In 1985, facing a funding shortfall, the Library closed the Branch and the site returned to business use.</p>

					<h3>Needham Public Library</h3>

					<p>The Proprietors of the Needham Library formed in 1796 as an association to provide the townspeople with books. Each member paid $3.00 to join, and an annual fee of twenty-five cents was put aside for additional books. Over the years there were several other private or subscription libraries, open to those who could pay the fees.</p>

					<p>In 1888 Town Meeting voted to establish a free public library, open to everyone; it was to be funded by the dog tax. The Free Public Library was first located in a rented room above a store on Great Plain Avenue, moving to a larger space in the Emery Grover Building in 1898, and then to the Town Hall in 1908. Lack of space, however, was a constant problem, and larger quarters were needed.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1910lib.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>This is Needham’s first public library building, built in 1904 at the corner of Highland Avenue and Mellen Street.  The land and building were donated by manufacturer William Carter and by Andrew Carnegie.  Residents of Needham Center, however, were not pleased about locating the library in the Heights, so within 10 years, town funding was found to build the current library on the corner of Highland Avenue and Rosemary Street.  Christ Church (Episcopal) was at that time next to the Library, and moved to its current location near Rosemary Street a few years later.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Proposals were made to build the Public Library its own building, but this effort stalled over expenditure in 1904.  To solve this problem, Needham manufacturer and philanthropist William Carter, and Andrew Carnegie (a self-educated man, and strong supporter of the free public library movement) built a library building on land donated by Carter at the corner of Mellen Street and Highland Avenue. Residents of Needham Center, however, were not entirely pleased that the town’s first Library was located in the Heights, so they continued to use the Town Hall rooms in preference to using a library in the Heights. So, within 10 years the money was found to build a new building.  William Carter gave the town land on Rosemary Street (the traditional &#34;boundary&#34; between the two parts of town), and everyone was satisfied with the location.</p>

						<figcaption>Glover Hospital, 1950s, showing the new clinic building as the main structure</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital &#8211; Needham on Chestnut Street is about to open state-of-the-art cancer and surgical facilities, the latest part of a renovation and expansion that has been going on for several years.  The hospital has been an affiliate of the Deaconess hospital system since 1994.  After the Deaconess and Beth Israel Hospitals merged, the decision was made to expand and modernize the hospital into a regional medical center.  Looking at this modern hospital, it is hard to remember that underneath it all is a century-old local clinic, still known around town as The Glover.</p>

					<p>The Glover Home and Hospital was named after Frederick Pope Glover, who bequeathed his estate to the town for the purpose of founding a hospital in his name.  Glover was not a doctor, as is often supposed.  He had been, at various points in his life, a shoemaker, a shopkeeper, a gold prospector during the Gold Rush, a railroad surveyor, a mule-driver, a trail guide, real estate speculator, and again a shopkeeper.  He settled in Needham later in his life, and served the town in several capacities, including a term or two as Selectman.</p>

					<p>Around 1890, Glover set up a business near Harris Avenue selling spring water &#8211; drawing on the same source that supplied the Dedham St. reservoir.  The Bird&#39;s Hill Spring Water Company was successful, and Glover acquired a moderate fortune.  Without children or much other family, Needham was the main beneficiary of his generosity.</p>

					<p>When he died in 1901, Glover bequeathed his property and assets to the town on the condition that they convert his Chestnut Street home into a hospital within two years, or the funds would revert to the Overseers of the Poor for the relief of the deserving poor in town.  However, the town government did not want a hospital &#8211; the Boston hospitals were quite close enough, thank you.  They preferred to use the money for other purposes, particularly (and ironically) improvements to the municipal water system.</p>

					<p>But there were also strong factions in town who could see the benefits of having a local hospital. The mill owners in the Heights, especially J.B. Thorpe and William Carter, favored the plan for the benefit of their employees, who were subject to frequent injuries by the nature of their work. Local doctors, particularly William Mitchell, looked forward to having local access to surgical facilities.  Glover’s executor, William Moseley, was also a mill owner, and he dragged his feet in turning over the funds to the Overseers in expectation that the hospital plan would eventually come through.  It finally did in 1910, when Town Meeting reluctantly voted to accept the gift after all.  The hospital opened on September 16, 1912.</p>

					<p>The first hospital was an 11-bed facility, with small operating and obstetrical rooms, a nursery, and two wards.  Charges did not cover costs and the hospital was chronically in debt.  Nevertheless, it was well-used, especially for maternity &#8211; in its first full year of operation, there were 122 patients, and 22 babies.</p>

					<p>The hospital really came into its own in 1918, when the flu epidemic reached Needham.  The Spanish Influenza devastated Europe in the closing years of World War I.  It spread rapidly in the close and filthy conditions of the trenches, and the death rate among the already exhausted soldiers was high.  Troops returning from the Front accelerated the spread of the flu through the civilian population.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1920glover.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Glover Hospital, 1920s: Glover&#39;s house was converted into the original clinic, The Glover home and Hospital.  A more modern clinic was built to its north (left, in picture) in 1936 and the old Glover house became the nurses&#39; quarters.  When the building expanded again in the 1940s, the house was torn down to make room for the new wing.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The first cases in Needham were recorded in mid-September 1918, and by the following week totaled nearly 200. The Board of Health was not set up to meet such a crisis, and was completely overwhelmed.  Selectman David Murdoch organized an Emergency Health Committee of municipal officials, doctors, the Red Cross and the Visiting Nurses, and took over the hospital for emergency use.  The Committee established quarantine procedures, pressed the local tradesmen into service to expand the hospital&#39;s plumbing and heating systems, tripled the number of beds, hired additional doctors and nurses, set up an emergency kitchen, and dragooned 25 local drivers into using their cars as ambulances and transports.</p>

					<p>The outbreak finally subsided in January. There were several hundred cases and 121 hospitalizations, but only 22 deaths.  The relatively small number of deaths was a credit to the rapid actions of the Emergency Health Committee, and to the facilities and staff of the Glover Hospital.  The emergency did no good at all for the hospital&#39;s financial state, but following the flu outbreak, no one doubted any longer the benefits of having a good local hospital.  &#34;A hospital appeals very strongly to me.  The times through which we have just passed show how much we need such an institution.  A hospital will be a comfort always to those who need it.&#34; (Town Clerk Thomas Sutton, letter to the Needham Chronicle, 8 February 1919)

					<h5>The Needham Police Department</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1911police.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Needham Police in the Needham Bicentennial parade, 1911</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In the early days of Needham, those we now call Police Officers were called Constables. Although they had many duties, the most important were keeping the peace, and the collection of delinquent taxes. Every &#34;responsible&#34; man in town was required to fill the position for at least one year.  By the mid-1800s Needham began appointing special policemen when additional law enforcement might be needed, such as public celebrations. Night watchmen were also hired for special duty.</p>

					<p>Needham&#39;s first Chief of Police was Norman McKenzie, who held the office from 1891 until his death in 1929.  Formerly a night watchman, he went on daytime duty when he became Chief.  However, he was so ridiculed for wasting his time (and the town&#39;s money) that he reassigned himself to night duty.  Daytime police patrols became common only after 1900, when the electric trolley lines brought larger numbers of people into town.</p>

					<p>Our first police vehicle was a horse and wagon, borrowed when needed.  The wagon also served as an ambulance, although it was too short and the stretchers stuck out in the back. Chief McKenzie had long argued for a replacement, because The wagon was finally replaced by a Ford Phaeton police cruiser in 1930.</p>

					<p>From its beginning to the present day, the Needham Police Department has lost only two men in the line of duty, when Francis O. Haddock and Forbes A. McLeod were shot during the robbery of the Needham Trust Company on February 2, 1934.</p>

					<p>As the population increased, the need for law-enforcement grew, and additional patrol officers were hired. Our present Police Departmen has approximately 40 officers. We have modern, up to date cruisers with on-board access to statewide databases; officers also maintain regular bicycle patrols, and are trained and equipped for water rescue.</p>

					<p>In addition to their law-enforcement duties, our police officers now work with many committees in town, such as traffic management, suicide prevention, emergency planning, domestic violence, and human rights. They have come a long way from collecting delinquent taxes.</p>

The station was across the street from the current fire station, near the Needham Garden Center&#39;s repair center.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>For many years the fire department of Needham consisted of any men in town who were physically capable of fighting a fire. Records indicate that the volunteers were rewarded for their efforts with &#34;rum and spirits.&#34;</p>

					<p>By the early 1800s, Needham had organized a force of &#34;fire engineers&#34; to respond to fires in town, but for the most part this response was haphazard. Fires were fought with buckets of water, and the primary task was to rescue people and valuables from the burning building, since there was little chance of actually putting out a large fire. </p>

					<p>Needham began to acquire fire engines in the 1870s: hand-pumped tankers that could bring large amounts of water to the scene. Surrounding towns also sent engines to each other when needed. In 1885, the town organized a systematic fire response, building two fire houses&#8211; Company #1 in Needham Center, and Company #2 in the Heights. A town wide alarm system and a hydrant system were installed a few years later.  It was 1917 before the town purchased its first motorized fire apparatus, a combination pumper&#45;ladder which had a 60 horsepower engine.</p>

					<p>In 1941, a precedent was set when 62 women from 22 Massachusetts cities and towns were trained as fire-fighters.  Every week a group of Needham fire-fighters, headed by Chief Richard Salamone, taught them to climb ladders, to balance on an aerial ladder while keeping their hands free for action, to jump 30 feet from a tower into a life net, to fight a fire wearing gas masks, and to handle high pressure hoses. It is now taken for granted that women are fully capable of being fire-fighters, but in those early days of World War II it was an exceptional occurrence.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>The Needham Fire Department has grown from a small group of untrained volunteers to a permanent staff of well-trained professionals who take pride in protecting the lives and property of the citizens of the town.  Although we think of them first as fire-fighters, they are also expert as EMT&#39;s (emergency medical technicians), and hazardous materials handlers.</p>

					<h5>The 9/11 Memorial for First Responders</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/911dedication.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Dedication of the 9/11 Memorial, on 11 September 2014</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>On September 11, 2001, twelve of  Needham&#39;s First Responders rushed to New York City in response to the attacks on the World Trade Center.  These men spent many days working side-by-side with other first responders at Ground Zero.  The impact was profound and immeasurable.  Each year on September 11th, the Needham Police and Fire Departments pay tribute to the uniformed men and women who answered the call to action, and to the many who lost their lives on September 11, 2001:  343 firefighters, 60 police officers, 15 EMT/medics and 3 court officers, in addition to the 2000+ personnel who were injured.</p>   
					
					<p>The idea for a 9/11 Memorial was started by Mark McCullough and Joe O&#39;Brien (Needham Police Dept., ret.) in the summer of 2012.  They were discussing 9/11 Memorials and how there wasn&#39;t one in Needham, and that other Towns had memorials that featured an artifact from the World Trade Center.  The idea of having a memorial for the annual 9/11 ceremony grew from their conversations.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>The Needham 9/11 Memorial Committee was established to design and erect a memorial to honor those first responders, including our own Needham personnel. This new 9/11 Memorial for First Responders, located outside of the Needham Police & Fire Stations, is a respectful tribute and will provide a permanent place for the annual September 11th ceremony. The Needham Police and Fire Departments obtained a piece of a steel beam from one of the World Trade Center buildings.  This pitted and scarred piece of steel is approximately one foot square, and will be the centerpiece of the 9/11 Memorial.</p>

					<p>The memorial is designed to incorporate symbols of the several incidents on that day.  The base is in the shape of a pentagon, symbolizing the attack on the Pentagon.  The New York skyline and the Twin Towers represent the attacks on the World Trade Center, as does the steel beam fragment. The rear of the monument features rock and soil from the crash site of Flight 93 that went down in Shanksville, PA.  The etched portraits honor Needham’s own First Responders who took part in the 9/11 search and rescue. </p>

					<h5>Kimball School</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1880kimball.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Kimball School c. 1880 &#8211; as originally built</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>In 1853 a town committee was chosen to report on the condition of the town schools, and to consider the advisability of establishing one or more high schools. The although a high school was recommended, nothing was done. In 1864, another committee considered the need of a high school, and reported that the town was legally bound to have such a school. In May of that year the town voted to build two high schools, neither to exceed $1200 in cost.</p>

					<p>One, the West High School, was opened in Wellesley, which was the West Parish of Needham at the time. The other, the East High School, was opened in the upper part of the old Center school house (Nehoiden Street), but was soon after moved into Village Hall, a privately-owned business building on Great Plain Avenue.  The committee again proposed a new building to the 1869 Town Meeting. The idea was accepted, but the building committee could not finalize the details, so no action was taken. In the meantime the East High School classes were now being held at the Oakland Hall School, a private school on the corner of Highland Avenue and May Street.  In 1871, a grammar school was built on the corner of Chestnut and School Streets, for a cost of $10,000.  The building had three rooms, one on each floor.  The youngest children on the first floor, grammar school on the second &#8211; and at long last &#8211; a High School on the third.</p>

					<p>However, within five years the new School was so over-crowded that some classes had to be held in rented rooms above a store on Great Plain Avenue. So, in 1886 the school building was cut in half, and the ends separated. The area between the ends was filled with new classroom space, and new wings were added.  At the same time the name was changed to the Kimball School in honor of the Reverend Daniel Kimball, who had run a day and boarding school from his home at the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Marked Tree Road. Dr. Kimball was a member of the School Committee for 23 years, often serving as chairman. He was also the President of the first temperance society in town, a justice of the peace, and representative to the General Court.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1886kimball.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Kimball School after the additions were built in 1886.  There were two entrances &#8211; the girls&#39; entrance was on the left side, and the boys&#39; entrance on the right. (postcard, dated 1909)</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>When the school was first built, a water boy was chosen each day to go to the well and pump water into a pail, which was passed around while students drank from a tin dipper. The custom was stopped in 1890 when a public water supply was brought to the town.  Almost forty years later, a workman uncovered well masonry in the center of town. It turned out to be the old well, 30 feet deep, with about two feet of crystal clear water.</p>

					<p>In 1889 the town voted to spend $1500.00 to improve the ventilation in the Kimball School, and in 1897 proper rest rooms were erected in the basement at a cost of $250.00.  Stairs were later added to the sides of the building to be used as fire escapes, but shortly became the common way of entering the hallways.</p>

					<p>By 1930 the Kimball School was in such antiquated condition that the town was considering closing it.  At the same time a new fire and police building were badly needed. It was determined that the location of the school would be ideal for a fire and police station and would save the town some $40,000 for the cost of land. Closure of the Kimball depended not only upon having a suitable future site for the students, but authorization of the voters and the school committee. It was agreed that an addition to the Stephen Palmer School on May Street was the best solution. A special town meeting was called which approved the appropriations on June 28th; by the first week in December the new quarters were ready for some classes, and all was ready for the students when they returned from Christmas vacation. The last day of classes were held at the Kimball School on December 6, 1930. </p>

					<h3>The Norfolk Trust Co. Robbery, 1934</h3>

						<figcaption>Police and detectives gather at the Needham Trust Co. on the day after the robbery, to gather evidence</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>The Norfolk Trust Bank was robbed in February 1934 by the Millen-Faber gang from Boston. The members of the gang were brothers Murton and Irving Millen, Abraham Faber, and Norma Brighton Millen (wife of Murton, who drove the getaway car). They timed the robbery by the train schedule, so that the trains passing across Great Plain Avenue would hinder the police trying to reach the Bank.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/interior.jpg" width = "300">

					<p>The gang held up the Bank with machine guns &#8211; the first machine-gun crime in MA &#8211; wounding two of the Bank personnel, and briefly taking one hostage. During their escape, they also killed two members of Needham&#39;s small police force, Forbes McLeod and Francis Haddock, as they responded to the alarm. Assigned to downtown patrol, Haddock and McLeod were well known in the community. The robbers also wounded a fireman, Timothy Coughlin, as they sped through the Heights.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/gang.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The Millen-Faber gang (left to right):  brothers Irving and Murton Millen, and Abraham Faber.  Murton was a small-time crook when he teamed up with Faber, an MIT graduate.  The two planned a series of increasingly daring and violent robberies in the greater Boston area. In 1934, they stole a pair of Thompson sub-machine guns from the State Police Armory, and used them to hold up the Needham Trust Co. It is not clear why they targeted Needham, but possibly because they figured that a small-town police force would be no match for them.  They were tracked to New York and captured, and all three were executed.</figcaption>	
					</figure>

					<p>The robbers were caught fairly quickly, and the men tried and executed. The slain officers were given heroes&#39; funerals; schools and offices were closed so people could attend to pay their respects. In gratitude for their sacrifice, the town voted pensions to support their widows, and the Bank established a fund to provide education for their young children.</p>

They are the only Needham police officers killed in the line of duty.</figcaption>

					<h3>The Town Hall and Common</h3>

					<a href = "#BowlingGreen">First: The Bowling Green</a>

					<p><a href="map.html#map-page?towncenter" data-ajax="false" rel = "external"> Get directions. </a></p>

					<p>Needham at the turn of the 20th century was a town in transition, as a rising class of merchants and professionals settled into homes surrounding the new business center of Great Plain Avenue. Children spent more time in the classroom than they did at home learning their parents&#39; trades. And the excellent train service to Boston was making commuting &#8211; and suburban living &#8211; increasingly convenient.</p>

					<p>Needham was also undergoing a physical transition. In 1853, the new trains bypassed the old town center on Central Avenue and ran into the mostly-empty Great Plain. By 1880 the old center was abandoned. Then Wellesley split off from Needham in 1881. The town purchased a large square of land in 1884 to become the new Common, bounded by Highland and Great Plain Avenues and Chapel Street. Building a new Town Hall was debated for 20 years, but the new century brought new optimism and energy. Town Meeting recognized the urgent need for &#34;proper and fitting accommodations&#34; for the town&#39;s business &#8211; and a desire to present the town as a dynamic and modern locale for residence and commerce.

					 <p>Town Hall was a civic monument to Needham&#39;s Twentieth Century identity: &#34;We have only to consider... what is the necessary and wise course to pursue in providing a suitable building... so that the stranger landing in our town will not be obliged to ask, &#34;Where is the Town Hall?&#34; &#8211; but it will speak for itself, and for the progressive spirit of our people.&#34;</p> 
					 
					 <p>&#8211; Selectman Edgar H. Bowers</p>


					<h5>First Parish</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1870parish.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The first Parish church shown in its original location at the intersection of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue, circa 1870.  This intersection was the original center of Needham, but building the railroad through the Great Plain in 1853 drew businesses and activity toward the Center Station, creating a new center within about 20 years.  The First Parish church was lifted and moved to its current location on Dedham Avenue in 1878.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>The first organized parish in Needham was formed as a result of the separation of Needham from Dedham on November 6, 1711. The legal definition of a Town in Massachusetts was a church, a school, and the means to pay a minister. Therefore, the church was by law an essential part of the town governance.</p>
					
					<p>The church was originally located in the old town center, at the corner of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue. The current (third) structure, which dates to 1836, was lifted and moved to the corner of Great Plain and Dedham Avenues in 1878 after the advent of the railroad caused the town center to shift to its present location. The bell in its steeple, which still rings today, was cast by Paul Revere in 1811 for the Needham Centennial.</p>
					
					<p>The church&#39;s recent renovations restored the historic sanctuary, expanded the program space, and reduced energy usage by 50% - making it the first house of worship in Massachusetts to earn the EPA&#39;s Energy Star rating.</p>

					<h5>The Needham Paramount Cinema</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1944theater.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>Needham Paramount Theater in 1944.  The picture can be dated by its marquee, which announces the film &#34;Arsenic and Old Lace&#34; with Cary Grant. The neighboring stores are a she store, a hat shop, a clothing store, and a diner.</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>When the idea of a movie theater in Needham arose in 1913, concerned citizens had many objections, stating it would be a major threat to the morality of young people, not to speak of the damage to their eyes. Obviously school work would suffer, and nearby property would decrease in value.</p>

					<p>All applications for a permit were denied until 1915, when Selectman David Murdoch was allowed to open a theater in the Bourne building on the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chestnut Street. One of the regulations in the license named the Selectmen as censors, and Murdoch resigned from the Board to avoid conflict of interest. The theater was a success despite the lack of facilities for music to accompany the silent movies, and in 1925 he constructed a new building, specifically designed to be a theater, on Great Plain Avenue between Dedham Avenue and the intersection with Pickering Street.</p>

					<p>The theater was a showplace, with marble walls, a circular domed ceiling in the lobby, and a special theater organ which supplied the musical background until talkies were developed. Decorative plaster pieces, including a crest with the theater&#39;s initials, were displayed throughout the building. With 768 leather seats in the orchestra and 348 in the balcony, the patrons had plenty of room to relax.</p>

					<p>The theater was run by Dave Murdoch, Jr. until 1929, when the building was leased to the Paramount Publix organization. In 1953 the Murdochs sold the building. Business declinesd in the 1960s as audiences were drawn to the large showcase theaters, and in 1978 the theater was sold to two men who attempted to bring X-rated movies to Needham. Intervention by the Selectmen put a stop to that immediately.  By the 1980s, the building was caught up in a property dispute, maintained by neither side (for fear that the other would benefit), and the building deteriorated quickly. In 2001 the old theater was razed by the Town for safety reasons.  All that is left are a few pieces of plaster and lots of memories of pep rallies, shows, and movie date nights. A new building containing shops and condominiums is being built at the site.
					</p>

					<h5>Police Kiosk</h5>

					<figure>

						<figcaption>The police kiosk at Dedham Avenue, 1946 &#8211; the policeman at his post, 1946. </figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>Until 1915 the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Dedham Avenue was a triangular piece of land owned by Clifford M. Locke. Close to the point of the triangle was a 65 foot elm tree, which sheltered a horse drinking trough. Traffic was difficult, and made worse by trolley tracks near the tree. At the suggestion of the Board of Selectmen Mr. Locke deeded the land to the town, the tree was taken down and a street section was built with granite curbing. There was a desirable improvement at the site due to an increase in safety to automobiles, and a more pleasant appearance.  As traffic increased in the center of town a small kiosk was set up on an island in the center of the intersection. During heavy commuter times a policeman would stand in the kiosk and direct traffic. This arrangement lasted until 1970, when the island was removed and signal lights were installed</p>

					<h5>The Crest</h5>

					<figure>
						<img src = "images/1950screst.jpg" width = "300">
						<figcaption>The Crest, 1950s</figcaption>
					</figure>	

					<p>Located at the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chapel Street, The Crest provided several generations of Needhamites with newspapers, cigars, comic books, ice cream, and other miscellaneous goods.  The store opened during the First World War, and stayed in business until 1995.  The location was the site of several short-lived banks, and is now houses a wine store, but the corner is still frequently referred to as The Crest.</p>

						<figcaption>Moseley Block 1880 &#8211; the large business/retail building on the SW corner of great Plain Avenue and Chestnut street was first known as the Moseley Block, though later owners changed the name (May Block, then Bourne Block).

					<h3>George Washburn House (1855)-301 Nehoiden Street</h3>	
					<p> Not much is known about George W. C. Washburn, who built this house in 1855. He was a banker, probably coming to Needham from Boston sometime shortly before that year. An 1854 map of the Great Plain Village shows that he had bought up numerous house lots in the area surrounding the Center train station, presumably for resale. His residential property extended beyond his own house on Nehoiden Street all the way to the corner of Great Plain Avenue and westward almost to Marshall Street.</p>

					<p>The Washburn House is very different in style to its neighbor, the Kingsbury-Whitaker House, even though the two differ in age by only 15 years. The railroad into Needham brought new residents, taking of advantage of the easy commute to move out of the city and into the more pleasant and roomy outlying towns. They also brought new, more modern, styles of architecture. The Kingsbury-Whitaker House, built before the railroad, is an excellent example of the spare colonial style of building that prevailed in Needham since the 1700s (see Sites #7 and 8, 13, 14). The Washburn House, built only two years after the railroad, is an elegant Italianate Victorian, with decorative brackets, arched double windows and an abundance of interior and exterior detail.</p> 

					<p>In the two decades that followed, a number of Victorian-style houses were built in Needham Center near the railway station (see Site #22), but the Washburn House was the first such example, and one of the best.</p>

					<h3>Kingsbury-Whitaker House (1710/1840) 53 Glendoon Road</h3>

<img src="kingsburywhitaker.jpg.png" 
style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The Kingsbury-Whitaker house, probably 1880s.  Note the walk-out window on the second floor, the bow window on the front right, and the ell that extends to connect to the carriage house (just out of view).  These fancier details were probably added after the 1850s.</figcaption> </figure>
					
	<p> Built originally in 1710, the Kingsbury-Whitaker House is one of the oldest standing houses in Needham, second only to the Robert Fuller House (1707) on Forest Street. As first built, the house was a small saltbox (two rooms on the first floor, loft above) and faced west, toward Nehoiden Street. It was the home of Deacon Timothy Kingsbury, one of the signers of the Dedham Farmers&#39; Petition that separated Needham from Dedham. Kingsbury&#39;s daughter Sarah, born in February 1712, was Needham&#39;s first baby. </p>

					<p>The house was purchased by Edgar Whitaker in 1839 and substantially renovated and expanded to take its present farmhouse form. Whitaker was part of the company that brought the railroad to Needham. The rebuilt house was nearly twice as large, and faced Great Plain Avenue. There was a lawn and a walk bordered by pines that led from Great Plain Avenue to the house. Whitaker landscaped the property into gardens and terraced lawns, a gazebo and tennis courts. He would sit out in his gardens with his guests and watch the trains pull into the Center Station.</p>

					<p> The property was purchased by David Murdoch in the 1920s. Murdoch subdivided the property for building, and laid out the Washburn Ave. and Glendoon Road house lots. A transplanted Scot, Murdoch named Glendoon Road after the Glen Doone, in Scotland.</p>

					<p> In addition to the lot his house stood on (see Site #18), George Washburn&#39;s property included a large adjacent lot on the corner of Nehoiden Street and Great Plain Avenue.  Although this lot was Washburn&#39;s property, the town made frequent use of it in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a municipal park, gathering place, and playing field &ndash; much in the same way the Memorial Park is used now. Adult athletic leagues played on Washburn&#39;s Field, as did school teams. Town celebrations were held here. Washburn&#39;s Field was the usual battleground of the Needham-Wellesley football game.</p>

					<p>By 1920, a large open field in the town center became too valuable an asset to leave idle. Needham was growing rapidly, advertising itself as a pleasant suburban town for growing families, with clean air and water, numerous daily trains, and plenty of space for &quot;you and the babies&quot; (in the words of a Board of Trade billboard). The field was purchased by developers David Simon and David Murdoch, who laid out Washburn Avenue and built 15 new houses (most of them still standing).</p>

<figcaption> The Congregational Church&#39;s first structure on Linden Street, 1890.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> The Evangelical Congregation church was formed in 1856, when more conservative members of the Unitarian church (First Parish) sought a return to their Trinitarian origins. This disagreement had been growing within the First Parish since the 1830s, as the ministers increasingly drew the parish toward Unitarianism. Dissenters within the parish sought a return to the orthodoxy of
					the Puritan church, and &quot;that the Institutions of the Gospel founded by the early settlers in New England should be established in their vicinity.&quot; The effort to form the new congregation was led by Dr. Josiah Noyes, Needham&#39;s physician; he and his wife, Elizabeth Hunt Noyes, are the first two names on the parish covenant.</p>

					<p>The first Congregational meeting house was built in 1859 on the corner of Chapel Street (hence the name); this small chapel served until 1886, when the congregation had raised enough money to purchase land on the corner of Linden Street and built a large new church. The old chapel was sold to the new parish of St. Joseph, and served as the Catholic church for the next few years. It was torn down in 1928 when Chapel Street was extended to meet May Street.</p>

					<p>The Congregational Church&#39;s wooden structure burned down in 1924, and was replaced by a new brick church. This building served until 1955, when the church was enlarged to its present form and the former brick sanctuary became the parish hall.</p>

<figcaption>  Four Victorian houses on Great Plain Avenue &ndash; from left to right: the Edward Proctor House, 1875 (1167 Great Plain Avenue); the Dr. Albert Kingsbury House, 1873 (1175 Great Plain Avenue); the Peady Mills House, 1875 (1189 Great Plain Avenue); and the Timothy Otis Fuller House, 1875 (1197 Great Plain Avenue).  It is likely that the Mills and Fuller houses were built by the same builder; they are nearly identical in appearance, were built at the same time, and TO Fuller was the nephew of Peady Mills.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> 1167 Great Plain Avenue, the Edward Proctor House, 1875</p>
					<p>1175 Great Plain Avenue, the Dr. Albert Kingsbury House, 1873</p>
					<p>1189 Great Plain Avenue, the Peady Mills House, 1875</p>
					<p>1197 Great Plain Avenue, the Timothy Otis Fuller House, 1875</p>

					<p>These beautiful houses represent the start of Needham&#39;s transformation from a farming town to a residential suburb. Before 1850, most residents were farmers or craftspeople, or small merchants whose businesses catered to a largely farming population. The most common house style was the flat-fronted center-entry colonial &ndash; such as the houses of Amos Fuller (Site #14) and Luther Morse(Site #13) &ndash; a style that remained unchanged in town for more than a century.</p>

					<p>When the train came in 1853, the new railroad line was denied permission to connect with the old town center on Central Avenue, so it ran to the sparsely-occupied Great Plain instead. By 1854, within only one year, speculators had bought up Great Plain land and divided it into house lots. Easy access to Boston and more distant towns not only provided new markets for Needham produce, but also brought in new residents, ideas and fashions. A rising class of merchants and professionals who were not tied to the farming economy began to build in the Great Plain to be nearer the railway. Within the next 20 years, numerous elegant residences in the more &quot;modern&quot; Victorian styles would be built on the roads that radiated out from the station &ndash; especially Maple Street, Great Plain Avenue and Dedham Avenue &ndash; as the Great Plain became the new focus of economic and community activity.</p>

					<h3>The Marked Tree</h3>	
					<p> The name of the road commemorates the Marked Tree, an ancient oak that once served as a reference point and boundary marker. The actual location of the Tree was at what is now the intersection of Marked Tree Road and High Rock Street. The name &quot;Mark Tree Road&quot; was in use since at last the 1820s if not earlier, and the road itself is shown on the map of 1836, but not on earlier maps. The Tree itself died and was cut down sometime in the late 1800s.</p>

					<p>In the absence of fixed reference points like the local survey grid or the USGS Survey, property and community boundaries, milestones, and so forth were measured from familiar landmarks &ndash; trees, stone walls, houses, rocks. We might have no idea now where to find &quot;a Road laid out from John Kingsbury&#39;s house, as the Road is now traveled, until it comes to the Road leading by John Alden&#39;s house&quot; &ndash; but it made perfect sense to Needhamites in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

					<h3>The Nathan McIntosh House (probably 1840s) - near 1386 Great Plain Avenue</h3>	

<img src="Mcintosh.jpg.png" 
style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The Nathan McIntosh house, probably around 1900.  Notice the half-underground first floor, that leads directly into the workshops.  Although a dwelling for the family, the majority of space in houses like this were used for work and storage.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> This house was built sometime between 1840 and 1850, probably by Nathan McIntosh. Nathan McIntosh was (among other things) a glue-maker, a shoemaker, a keeper (briefly) of his father&#39;s tavern (the McIntosh Tavern, Site #1).  He served the town as tax collector in the 1830s. Prior to this house, he had built and lived in the house across the street, at 1092 Central Avenue. He was a grandson of Needham&#39;s Revolutionary War hero, Colonel William McIntosh.</p>

					<p>The McIntosh House is typical of the farms and workshops that were common in Needham in the 19th century. The large barn to the rear was for storage of equipment, supplies, and livestock. The ell behind the main house, the shed in front of the barn, and the workyard in between, were all part of the productive space &ndash; over the years, producing glue, shoes, meat, and a number of other products. Ice was harvested from Trout Pond, to the east of the house, and sold from a shed on its banks.  The McIntosh house was probably torn down in the 1930s, when the present house was built and Needham was becoming a residential commuter town.</p>

<figcaption>The first image of Town Hall, taken just after it was completed in December 1903. Notice the houses on either side; it was originally planned that the streets near Town Hall would be desirable residential property.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> The first town meeting hall was the First Parish church, which served as both house of worship and public gathering space. Later, town affairs were conducted in commercial buildings such as Nehoiden Hall (see Site #15) whose open second floors provided enough room to gather.</p>

					<p> A &quot;town house&quot; with meeting space and offices was built in West Needham in 1869, but when that part of town split off to become Wellesley in 1881, the meeting hall went with it.  Town offices were once again housed in retail space, above the General Store on the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chestnut Street. The need for a new, central Town Hall was discussed as early as 1884, when a block of house lots bounded by Chapel Street, and Great Plain and Highland Avenues was purchased by the town and designated The Common.</p>

style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The Merchants and Trades Fair of 1916 took place in the large second-floor meeting hall.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> After nearly twenty years of debate, Town Meeting finally recognized the increasingly urgent need for &quot;proper and fitting accommodations&quot; for the conduct of town business &ndash; adequate space for the town offices; fireproof security for vital town records; and not least, a desire to present the town as a dynamic and modern locale for residence and business.  Town Hall was built in 1902, a civic monument to Needham&#39;s Twentieth Century identity. In 2010-2011, after serving the town well for more than 100 years, the Town Hall was renovated, restoring its splendor and preparing it for the next 100 years.

					<h3>First Parish Church (established 1711; current structure 1836) - 23 Dedham Avenue</h3>																

<img src="firstparish.jpg.png" 
style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The first parish church, just after its move to Dedham Avenue, c 1880.  The building in the background is the Kimball School, on School Street.</figcaption> </figure>

					<p> The first organized parish in Needham was formed as a result of the separation of Needham from Dedham on November 6, 1711. The legal definition of a Town in Massachusetts was a church, a school, and the means (taxation) to pay a minister.  The Meeting House was also the town&#39;s public meeting place, and Town Meeting usually followed Sunday services.  These were the days before the separation of church and state, and the church was by law an essential part of the town governance.</p>

					<p>The church was originally located in the old town center, at the corner of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue. The original building burned down in 1774 (see Site #6); and the second structure was torn down in 1836.  The current (third) structure, which dates to 1836, was lifted and moved to the corner of Great Plain and Dedham Avenues in 1878 after the advent of the railroad caused the town center to shift to its present location. The bell in its steeple, which still rings today, was cast by Paul Revere in 1811 for the Needham Centennial.</p>  

					<p>The church&#39;s recent renovations restored the historic sanctuary, expanded the program space, and reduced energy usage by 50% - making it the first house of worship in Massachusetts to earn the EPA&#39;s Energy Star rating.</p>

					<p> This retail block was built in 1874, as the second commercial building in the new Needham Center, after the Village Hall on the corner of Garden Street (see Site #28a).

					<p> Typical of retail blocks in its day, the Moseley Building had a number of retail stores at street level, anchored by the large general store at the corner. The second floor had a large open meeting and assembly hall, and a number of smaller rooms on the second and third floors served for offices and storage. One picture, taken c. 1885, shows the T .J.

					<p> In 1881, after the split with Wellesley, the Town rented the rooms and offices above Crossman&#39;s store to use as a temporary Town Hall. For nearly 20 years it housed the town offices, records, and the police lock-up. After Town Hall was built in 1902, the meeting hall was used by a number of groups, including the Episcopal Society, the Needham Young People&#39;s Association, and the Public Library, before becoming the first location of the Needham Cinema. The Moseley Building was torn down in 1928, replaced by the current retail building.

					<h3>Odd Fellows' Hall (1874) - northwest corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chapel Street</h3>																

<img src="oddfellows.jpg.png" 
style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The Odd Fellows Hall, built in 1874 at the corner of Great Plain Avenue and Chapel Street (currently the location of Needham Center Fine Wines).  This was Needham&#39;s largest and fanciest retail building at the time.  The road in the foreground is Great Plain Avenue.  The white house at the left margin of the picture is the Evangelical Congregational Chapel (see Site #21).  The garden at left is part of the Center Station train yard. </figcaption> </figure>

					<p> &quot;The penetrating whistle of the Boston train arriving at midnight on Friday of last week, gave [the alarm] to the people of Needham that its principal and most ornate business block, Odd Fellows Building, was in flames&#8230;&quot;  (The Needham Chronicle, May 21, 1887)</p>  															

<img src="firebird.jpg.png" 
style="width:304px;height:228px">
<figcaption> The Odd Fellows fire from above (probably taken from the roof of the train shed in the rail yard next door).  The roads are Great Plain Avenue (running right-left) and Chapel/Chestnut Streets (diagonal).  The Common is visible at left, with the flagpole and platform.  The steeple of the First Parish church is visible on the corner of Dedham Avenue, and the Moseley Building is on the corner to the right.  In the foreground is the open rail yard, and the oval garden (the &quot;Depot Mound&quot;).  The burned structure in the front right corner is the original wooden Center Station, which also caught fire (see Site #28). </figcaption> </figure>

					<p> This extravagant, three-plus story High Victorian structure was built in 1874, the third business block in Needham&#39;s new town center.  For nearly two centuries, Needham&#39;s center was at the intersection of Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue, near the main coach roads.  Once the railroad was built in 1853, crossing the sparsely-occupied Great Plain, businesses and homes were increasingly drawn to the vicinity of the Center Station as a commercial building.</p>

					<p> The Hall had three full floors for offices and retail, and businesses included a men&#39;s haberdasher, a printing business, a dentist&#39;s office, a barber shop, and the news offices of the Needham Chronicle. The fourth floor held large rooms that were used for meeting space, as well as the meeting hall and War Museum of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Civil War veterans&#39; organization. The Odd Fellows Building was by far the largest and most ornate building Needham had yet seen, with large decorative windows, an excess of pilasters and moldings, peaked dormers, a multi-hued slate mosaic roof, and a central turret with a glass cupola.</p>

					<p>The Odd Fellows&#39; Hall burned down in a huge fire on the night of May 20, 1887 &ndash; a fire so fierce that it completely reduced the structure to rubble, taking with it the properties and equipment of the resident businesses, a considerable portion of Needham&#39;s Civil and Revolutionary War memorabilia, and the original wooden Center Station house (see Site #28).  It was quickly determined that the fire was caused by arson.  The Town offered a reward, but the culprit was never identified and the reward never claimed. Rubble from the Hall was pushed into the cellar hole, where it remained &ndash; derelict and fenced-off &ndash; until the current storefront was built on the site in 1916.

					<p>The gang held up the Bank with machine guns that they had stolen from an exhibit of new equipment at the State Police Armory.  This was the first machine-gun crime in MA, a crome so audacious that initial reports attributed it to Pretty Boy Floyd. The gang wounded two of the Bank personnel during the robbery, briefly taking one hostage. During their escape, they killed two members of Needham&#39;s small police force &ndash; Officers Forbes McLeod and Francis Haddock &ndash; as they responded to the alarm. Assigned to downtown patrol, Haddock and McLeod were familiar figures in the community.  Both were veterans of Word War I.  Both were married, with families.  The robbers also wounded a fireman, Timothy Coughlin, as they sped through the Heights.</p>

					<p>The robbers were caught fairly quickly, and the men tried and executed. The slain officers were given heroes&#39; funerals; schools and offices were closed so people could attend to pay their respects. In gratitude for their sacrifice, the town voted pensions to support their widows, and the Bank established a fund to provide education for their young children.</p>

					<h3>Center Station</h3>
					<p>The original Center Station, built in 1857, was a wooden shed.  This burned  during the Odd Fellows fire, and was replaced with a Richardson&ndash;style stone structure.<p>
					<img src="28 new Center Station 1887.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">
				

					<p>Needham Center and Needham Heights were the two original train stations, built when the line was laid in 1853. The trains lines were originally built to facilitate the transport of gravel from the Heights area to fill Boston&#39;s Back Bay. But the ease of travel to Boston that the trains provided quickly became a benefit for merchants, commuters, and any resident who wanted easy access to the economic and cultural attractions of Boston.</p>

					<p>The rail yard originally took in the whole area that is now the parking lot and business locations between Great Plain Avenue and May Street, and included sidings, a car shed, a coal shed, a water tank, and a turntable. The first station house was a small shed built of wood; it burned down in 1887 during the huge fire that destroyed the Odd Fellows&#39; Hall (see Site #26). A Richardson-style pink and brown stone structure was built to replace it. Parts of this building are still standing (currently housing a restaurant), though the turret and much of the attractive detail has been lost over the years.</p>

					<h3>Hotel Nehoiden</h3>
					<p>The Ingols Block, probably in the 1890s.<p>
					<img src="29 Ingols block.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">
					

					<p>The commercial building at 95 Chapel Street was built sometime around 1880, one of several commercial properties owned by Caroline Ingols. It was originally known as the &quot;Ingols Block&quot; after its owner, and housed a number of retail establishments, including the J. A. Tilton Company which sold stoves, grain, feed and poultry supplies. The building was later converted into a hotel, first the Hotel Union House-McKenzie, and later the Hotel Nehoiden. It is now again a retail site.<p>

					<p>The small building to its right is of similar age, and has housed (among others) a photographic studio and the press room for the Needham Chronicle.  Because of the rapid pace of development since 1900, there are very few old buildings left in the downtown. The Ingols Block and its small neighbor are the oldest remaining downtown buildings, predating the rest by at least two decades.</p>

					<h3>Appleton Home</h3>
					<p>There are no photos of the Appleton Home. This image is from the masthead of their monthly newsletter. The stands of pine trees at either side of the drive inspired the name of the boarding house that took over the building in 1882 &ndash; &quot;The Pines.&quot;<p>
					<img src="30 Appleton home.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

					
					<p>The Appleton Temporary Home was a charitable organization, dedicated to the care of men &quot;reduced by circumstances and indulgence in intoxicating drink, who had signed a pledge&quot; &ndash; a pledge to abstain. The men spent their recovery time working for the Home by refurbishing and maintaining its buildings and grounds, including stables, a gymnasium and a bowling alley. The Home opened in 1875, and operated until 1881. It was sponsored by the Temperance Society of the Boston YMCA, and had strong support in Needham, which had several temperance societies of its own.<p>

					<p>Prior to the Appleton Home, the building was home to a private girls&#39; school, the Oakland Institute, and later a boys&#39; school called Oakland Hall. Oakland Hall closed in 1870, leaving the building vacant and deteriorating for five years before it was occupied by the Appleton Home.<p> 

					<p>After the Appleton Home closed, the house was purchased by Mrs. Clementina B. Cummings and converted into a summer boarding house known as &quot;The Pines.&quot; The Pines closed in 1892, and the building was shifted to an adjacent lot at the corner of May Street and Oakland Avenue. It was torn town in 1964 when St. Joseph&#39;s built the current church.</p>

					<img src="31 emery grover postcard.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">


					<p>The Emery Grover Building was built in 1898 as the first Needham High School.  Prior to that time, high school classes were held on the top floor of the Kimball Primary School on School Street. The new school housed three classes (grades 10-12) of about 10-15 students each, three teachers, and a principal. Unlike the lower grades, the high school teachers were college graduates. The archway on the south side was the boy&#39;s entrance, and the archway on the right was for the girls.<p>

					<p>The High School used the building until 1924, when a larger new high school (called the Highland Avenue School) was built on the lot to its north. The present High School was built in 1930, replacing the two older buildings. The Highland Avenue School served as Junior High School for a while, and then both it and the Emery Grover held overflow classes from the high school and junior high.<p>

					<p>Emery Grover (1842-1920) was a lawyer and judge. Judge Grover (as known) also served in numerous town offices, especially as selectman and for a long time as a member of the school committee. It is for his dedication to the schools that the School Administration building was named after him. </p>

					<h3>Jonathon Kingsbury House</h3>
					<p>The Jonathan Kingsbury house, circa 1880. The house originally faced Webster Street with entry directly into the front room, but renovations in the 1950s shifted the entry to the Rosemary Street side and converted the front room to a living room with fireplace.<p>
					<img src="32 jonathan kingsbury house.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

	
					<p>The Kingsbury family was one of the original settlers of the Dedham Grant in 1636, and held large tracts of land in the North Parish (later Needham), especially along the central stretch of Webster Street between Great Plain Avenue and Highland Avenue.  Webster Street was called Kingsbury Street until about 1850. There are numerous antique Kingsbury houses still standing in this part of town, and old maps show that there were once many more.<p>

					<p>Jonathan Kingsbury (Jr.) was a weaver, and a great-great grandson of the John mentioned in the land grant of 1636 (see Site #33). He served with the East Company of the Needham militia at Lexington in 1775, and also at Dorchester Heights and Boston in 1776 and 1778. At the time of his marriage to Jemima Skinner in 1764, he was sharing a house with his uncle, but as his family began to grow (they would have at least ten children) he needed more room and built a house for himself in 1779.<p>

					<p>The house as originally built opened onto Webster Street, with a central door in the east facade. The door was blocked up and a fireplace added in the 1940s, and the side door on the south facade became the main entry.</p>

					<h3>Early Land Grant</h3>
					<p>Land deed from the Dedham proprietors to John Kingsbery for twelve acres between (now&ndash;) Webster Street and Rosemary Lake. The deed includes the site of Jonathan Kingsbury&#39;s house (Site #32) &ndash; the great&ndash;great&ndash;great&ndash;etc grandson of John Kingsbery.<p>
					<img src="33 land deed Kingsbury 1636.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

				
					<p>The oldest European object in the Historical Society collections is a little slip of paper about 6 inches square, a land deed from Dedham to John Kingsbury (or, Kingsbery, as he spelled it), dated 15 August 1636 in the Old (Julian) Calendar:<p>

					<p>&quot;Dedham Graunteth to John Kingsbery twelve acres more or less as it lyeth betwene ye waest & ye clayepits toward the North and ye river and medowe of the Sayd John towards the South. And abutts upon the swamp of the Sayd John and Mr. Thomas Eaeton towards the East, and upon the claypitts and the high waye leading to the same…&quot;<p>

					<p>As far as we can tell, this deed encompasses a plot from Webster Street down the hill to Rosemary Lake (then the &quot;Rosemary Meadows&quot;), and from Great Plain Avenue to Highland Avenue. What is most interesting about this, though, is the very early date. The Dedham Grant was made in late 1636. The ink on the royal signature was barely dry before John Kingsbury, Thomas Eaton, and others had petitioned to claim land.</p>

					<h3>Memorial Park</h3>
					<p>The Women&#39;s Relief Corps of the American Legion set up a camp kitchen across the street 
					(currently the Sudbury Farms parking lot) to feed the volunteers. Note the Library in the background.<p>
					<img src="34 Memorial park WRC lunch camp.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

					
					<p>The line is now fading, but long&ndash;term Needhamites remember when Rosemary St. was the &quot;boundary&quot; between Needham Center and Needham Heights.  The &quot;separation&quot; reflected social and economic changes in the 1850s, when new industries and immigrants transformed the Heights economy from farms to manufacturing, and created a new political and social culture that clashed with the more traditional culture of the Center.<p>

					<p>Even so, the construction of Memorial Park was an act of unity.  Needham had just recovered from the twin traumas of World War I and the influenza epidemic.  The town was more fortunate than many, suffering relatively few losses from either event.  Nevertheless, it had been two generations &ndash; the Civil War &ndash; since Needham had faced such tragedy.<p>  

					<p>On April 19, 1921, two parades set off with music and fanfare &ndash; one from the Center, and one from the Heights &ndash; to meet in the middle at Richwagen&#39;s Hill. 1700 people (one&ndash;third of the town) volunteered to work, bringing wheelbarrows and shovels, tractors and horses, to dig down the hill and create a level field.  Veterans of the War wore their old uniforms.  The Women&#39;s Relief Corps set up a an army field kitchen in the field across the street (now Sudbury Farms&#39; parking lot) to feed the workers. They served more than 100 pots of beans, 200 loaves of bread, 200 pies, 150 pounds of hot dogs, and 175 dozen doughnuts, all donated by the women of Needham.<p>

					<p>Memorial Park was dedicated &quot;To Those of Needham who Served their Country in the World War, 1917-1918, and in Memory of Those Who Died in Service.&quot;  More recently, additional monuments were dedicated in honor of Needhamites who served in the country&#39;s other wars.  Created by the community to honor its heroes, Memorial Park remains at the literal and figurative center of Needham as our park, playing field, and gathering place.</p>

					<h3>Needham Free Public Library</h3>
					<p>The Needham Public Library building, just after opening in 1915.<p>
					<img src="35 NFPL in 1915.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

				
					<p>The Proprietors of the Needham Library formed in 1796 as an association to provide the townspeople with books. Each member paid $3.00 to join, and an annual fee of twenty&ndash;five cents was put aside for additional books. Over the years there were several other private or subscription libraries, open to those who could pay the fees.<p>

					<p>In 1888 Town Meeting voted to establish a free public library, open to everyone; it was to be funded by the dog tax. The Free Public Library was first located in a rented room in the Moseley Building (see Site #25a), then moved to a larger space in the Emery Grover Building (Site #31) in 1898, and then to the Town Hall in 1908. But the lack of space was not resolved, and larger quarters were needed.<p>

					<p>In 1903, William Carter and Andrew Carnegie donated the land and funds, and the Library was built on the corner of Mellen Street and Highland Avenue (Site #44). The new building did not provide the solution, however, because the residents of Needham Center continued to use the Town Hall rooms in preference to using a library in the Heights. Finally, in 1915, the current Library was built when William Carter gave the town land on the boundary between the two villages, and everyone was satisfied with the location.</p>

					style="width:304px;height:228px">

					
					<p>Needham&#39;s first &quot;High School&quot; (1865) consisted of rented rooms above a store. In the mid&ndash;19th century, few students went to school beyond the 6th grade unless they aspired to a profession.  In the 1870s, the high school classes were moved to the top floor of the Kimball Grammar School on School Street, where they shared space with the fledgling Public Library.<p>

					<p>Not until the 1890s were there enough High School students to justify a school of their own, and then the number of students began to grow rapidly.  This growth reflected a significant shift in attitudes about education &ndash; the school population was rising fast as formal education became more important. For the first time in history, it could be expected that a child would spend more time in school than at home learning the skills and trades of his parents.  Teachers&#39; training also became more rigorous, especially for the upper grades.  While many elementary school teachers earned a Normal School degree (basically, high school plus one year), teachers at the high school were expected to be college graduates.<p>

					<p>The first Needham High School building was the (now&ndash;called) Emery Grover Building on Highland Avenue, built in 1898 (see Site #30). The Highland Avenue School was built when additional space was needed in the 1920s,  and finally the High School building we still use, in 1930.</p>

					<h3>Holmes House</h3>
					<p>The Nahum Holmes house just after completion, c. 1894. The neighborhood was just beginning to be developed for residential use following the emergence of the Great Plain as the new town center, so most of the lots are still empty. The house at left used to stand in the circle on Homestead Park, and the standpipe is on the top of Tower Hill.<p>
					<img src="37 holmes house.jpg"  
					style="width:304px;height:228px">

					
					<p>When the railroad came to Needham in 1853, the rail line was directed though the sparsely&ndash;populated Great Plain, rather than through the original town center at Nehoiden Street and Central Avenue. Access to the railroad, and the ease of travel and freight transport that resulted, quickly drew the focus of economic and residential activity into Great Plain Village and away from the old center. In 1878, when the First Parish Church was moved to its current location on Dedham Avenue, the change was complete and the Great Plain became the town center.<p>

					<p>Land in the Great Plain that had been used for grazing cattle or gardening rapidly became valuable as residential property, and local businessmen bought it up as investments, selling at it a profit as house lots for building. Between about 1860 and 1900 there was a boom in residential construction in the Great Plain. The northern half of Warren Street was laid out during this period, and is notable for the number of well&ndash;preserved historic houses from this period.<p>

					<p>Nahum Holmes built his house sometime around 1894. He was a photographer, who with his brothers owned the famous Holmes Brothers Studios. Holmes Brothers had several studio locations, including their primary one in Charlestown, and one in Needham. Many of the Historical Society&#39;s photos of Needham in the 1880s and 90s were taken by Holmes.</p>
